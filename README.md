# init_1

just a python script to make a new computer less of a hassle. Simply installs often used software like pip, node, npm, express etc.

## running the script

currently the script is written in python 2 so any python interpretor < 3 will do. 
you can run the script wherever it simply goes to your $HOME directory and starts installing all necessary components. 
the script will ask for a github username and clone all public repos for that user, if you simply want to ignore this operation hit enter without any name.
feel free to modify the script and use for whatever you want.
